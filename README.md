# Applying neural network knowledge

# What's lander?

Lander is the **first game** I produced in college, it was created using the **openGL** library and **C**.

**[Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yzaoxckBNc) of  game without application of neural networks**

# What's neural network?

Artificial neural networks, usually simply called neural networks, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain.
